A 2D game make whit allegro 5 library in C++ languaje, 

## Resourses
to this project we use this:

  Visual Studio
  Library Allegro 5       ->  necessary
  Lybrary AllegroDevs     ->  necessary
  C++ compiller           ->  necessary
```

## Mechanics

```python
To emulate a 2d game we test our knowledge in C ++ like pointers, pattern design, but halfway
we can't use the whole pattern we planned as a factory and that was due to a limitation of Allegro
with its graphical interface.
In the game we are a woman who does not want to make her family sick and had to protect herself from the moment he appears.
and save yourself when you get vaccinated
